## Tasks
### Level 1 - Automate table and date search
1.  Created a basic HTML web page
2.  Used dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects to write code that appends a table to web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
3.  Created columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.
4.  Used a date form in HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple search categories
1.  Used multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns to write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  * `date/time`
  * `city`
  * `state`
  * `country`
  * `shape`

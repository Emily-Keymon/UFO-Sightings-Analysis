# UFO Sightings Analysis

The purpose of this project was to write code that would create a table dynamically based upon a dataset. A website was created to allow users to filter the table data for specific values. Only JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js were used on this project.

---
## Dataset
* [UFO Sightings Data](UFO-level-1/static/js/data3.js)
* Dataset used for this project was modified to include the entirety of 2010.
** Note:  Original dataset provided contained data from 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010.

## Tools Used
* PyCharm - Python IDE
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3

## Tasks
### Level 1 - Automate table and date search
1.  Import UFO sightings data from JSON array.
1.  Created a basic HTML web page to publish data.
2.  Wrote code to append a table to the web page and then add new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
3.  Created columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.
4.  Used a date form in HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2 - Multiple search categories
1.  Used multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns to write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:
  * `date/time`
  * `city`
  * `state`
  * `country`
  * `shape`
